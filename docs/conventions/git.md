# Git workflow

## Git Workflow

- Stay on `staging`. Do not create feature branches.
- Commit directly on `staging`.
- PRs target `staging`, never `main`.
- **NEVER use `--no-verify` or `--no-gpg-sign`** on any git command.

### `git add -A` is the rule, not a suggestion

Multiple Claude Code workers run side-by-side on this repo's `staging` branch at all times. When you commit, **other workers' uncommitted changes may already be in your working tree** — that is expected, not a bug. The rule:

**Always `git add -A` before committing.** Run `git status --short` first: if it lists sandbox worktree gitlinks (`worktrees/*`, `.claude/worktrees/*`) or build output (`.build-*`, `dist/`), add the path to `.gitignore` instead of committing it. Never cherry-pick individual files trying to "separate your changes from another worker's." Don't try to reason about which lines are "yours" and which aren't: that distinction is meaningless when sessions get compacted, contexts overlap, and the same agent picks back up with a stale model of what it already wrote. The working tree is the truth; commit all of it.

**Never `git stash` to "isolate your commit"** from another worker's in-progress changes. Stashing parks work in a per-clone reflog that other workers can't see and that gets lost on `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, or a worktree teardown — uncommitted work outside the index has no durable home. The entire point of the always-commit rule is that the index is the only place work survives.

The only acceptable workflow:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "..."
git push
```

Trust CI to catch broken intermediate states. If a partial refactor genuinely shouldn't deploy, **revert the offending lines as a follow-up commit**, don't stash them. If a commit message ends up bundling more files than the message describes, that's fine — the message is an approximation of "what shipped in this push," not a strict scope contract.
